<h1 style="color:#5A59A8">Executive Summary</h1>

<div style="text-align: justify">Getting accurate results is the goal of every machine learning project. But feeding data as it is to a model does not always give the desired outcome. And doing so will introduce certain biases to your machine learning model as it learns. One way to mitigate this problem is by feature transformation or feature scaling. But how would you exactly know what feature transformation technique to use in certain situations?</div>
&nbsp

<div style="text-align: justify">Data is transformed to make it better-organized. Transformed data may be easier for both humans and computers to use. [11] Feature transformation is an essential data preprocessing technique that ensures all of our metrics are uniform which allows for better model performance. This also ensures that algorithms moves smoothly and is applied and updated at the same rate for all features.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">For this notebook, we will explore nine (9) data transformation techniques and how these techniques boosts model performance. These techniques will be divided into three main categories namely: Function Transformation, Power Transformation, and Other Transformation. </div>
